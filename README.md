# Witchy2GameEngine

## Description

Witchy2GameEngine is a basic platformer game engine
that I am developing as part of my first-semester
university project. It's more of a rendering
engine than a full-fledged graphics engine,
but you get the idea.

The project aims to include a 2.5D level builder
(yet to be implemented) and provide basic
mechanisms to quickly create simple games.
It addresses the challenges of testing graphics
logic, which is often abstracted away in ready-made
engines. These engines simplify development but
make it difficult to explore and understand
the underlying graphics programming.



### Game Demo

This is a simple gameplay demonstration 
showcasing what can currently be created using
the Witchy2GameEngine. At this stage of
development, these are the core features
the engine supports. As the project evolves,
more advanced functionalities, such as a 2.5D
level builder and enhanced game mechanics,
will be implemented to expand its
capabilities..
